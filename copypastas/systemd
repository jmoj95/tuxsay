First off, systemd is not an init system, it has an init system as part of the
systemd suite. systemd is a project to build a standardised lowlevel userland
for Linux. The project is pretty comprehensive and it delivers a lot of
functionality under one umbrella. It does away with a lot of older,
often undermaintained software packages, which were traditionally used to
assemble a low level userland.

Which is where the contention comes from, as a system suite systemd is
restrictive for Unix virtuosi who are used to tailor a system with wit,
ingenuity, a lick and a prayer and a couple dozen of unrelated packages.
systemd makes such knowledge useless.

The faction that thinks that systemd is Linux's Hiroshima, finds all
the added functionality bloat, unnecessary and dangerous, as it is all under
development in one project.

All the systemd jokes stem from the comprehensiveness as a low level
system suite. People against it love to joke that one day systemd
will write its own kernel.

There is a lot of FUD and hate going around. Some arguments do have merit,
a lot of eggs in one basket is certainly true, but as with all things in life,
it depends which tradeoff you prefer. Do you want a suite of well
designed software, working closely together, so that system management is
streamlined or do you want the complete freedom to tailor your own low level
system with a lot of time tested, interchangeable components.

I have no desire to be a low level system designer, so I prefer systemd.
I don't hate traditional init systems though. If a Linux system has one and
I need to work with it, I'm still happy it boots and starts
the necessary services.
